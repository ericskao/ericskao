                My name is Eric Kao. Iâ€™m a frontend software engineer & freelance web developer in
                the Bay Area.
                <br />I have over 7 years of professional React and TypeScript experience. I've
                worked with teams as small as 3... up to Series C startups and public sized
                companies.
              </p>
              <p>
                As a software engineer, I enjoy working with cross-functional teams, where I get to
                bridge the gap between design, product management, and business needs. I'm
                comfortable making design and front-end architectural decisions, and transforming
                mocks into production ready applications.
              </p>
              <p>
                As a consultant, I have experience working with business owners and loose
                requirements. I pride myself on building accessible and solving problems for a
                variety of clients. <a href="mailto: ericskao@gmail.com">Let's build together.</a>
