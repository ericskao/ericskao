            My name is Eric Kao. Iâ€™m a frontend software engineer & freelance web developer in the
            Bay Area.
            <br />I have over 7 years of professional React and TypeScript experience. I've worked
            with teams as small as 3, up to Series C startups, and up to public sized companies.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a software engineer, I enjoy working with cross-functional teams, where I get to
            bridge the gap between design, product management, and business needs. My specialty lies
            in architecting accessible, responsive solutions for the web.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a consultant, I engineer solutions for clients and business owners. I have experience
            taking loose requirements and building dynamic user experiences. For static sites, I use
            latest technologies to optimize fast, SEO driven interfaces.
          </p>
          <p>
            In my free time, I enjoy learning new frontend technologies and playing with new
            frameworks. I've spent the last few years building apps for the web3 world and this year
            I have been tinkering more in the backend in Node.
