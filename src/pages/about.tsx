              As a software engineer, I enjoy working with cross-functional teams, where I get to
              bridge the gap between design, product management, and business needs. My specialty
              lies in architecting accessible, responsive solutions for the web.

              I build solutions for clients and business owners. I transform loose requirements into
              dynamic user experiences. For static sites, I use modern technologies to develop fast,
              accessible, SEO driven interfaces.

              In my free time, I enjoy learning new frontend technologies and playing with new
              frameworks. I've spent the last few years building apps for the web3 world and this
              year I have been tinkering with Node in the backend.
